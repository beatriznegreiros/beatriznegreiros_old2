Mrs. Negreiros is a civil engineer graduated by the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, which currently finished her studies in Water Resources Engineering and Management ([WAREM](https://www.warem.uni-stuttgart.de/)) at the University of Stuttgart, Germany. In 2018, she was awarded a scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service ([DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/)) to pursue a career in Sustainable Water Resources in Germany; the scholarship program included funding for German Language Course and the Master’s Program. Mrs. Negreiros has demonstrated experience in hydrological modelling during her Bachelor’s Thesis and worked as a research assistant for more than one year at the Institute of Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems at the University of Stuttgart, where she expanded her skills in hydraulic and sediment transport modelling. She has been involved not only with numerical modelling and coding, but also with field measurements. Currently, Mr. Negreiros works as a research associate in the Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems ([IWS](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/), Universität Stuttgart, Germany).
