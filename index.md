Civil engineer graduated from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/), Brazil, with Master's degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management ([WAREM](https://www.warem.uni-stuttgart.de/)) by the University of Stuttgart, Germany. In 2018, she was awarded a NaWaM (Nachhaltiges Wassermanagement) scholarship by the German Academic Exchange Service ([DAAD](https://www.daad.de/en/)) with full funding to pursue both German proficiency and Master's studies. Beatriz has demonstrated experience in hydrological modelling from her Bachelor’s Thesis entitled "Application of the hydrological model MGB-IPH in the Seridó River Basin (Brazil)" (access in [English](https://static.iahr.org/library/Proceedings/TechnicalEvent/tcEPD/2020YPCongress/Proceedings_1st_IAHR_Young_Professionals_Congress_2020.pdf) or in [Portuguese](https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/abrh/Eventos/Trabalhos/60/PAP022622.pdf)) . She worked as a student research assistant for more than one year at the Institute of Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems at the University of Stuttgart, where she expanded her skills in hydro-morphodynamic modelling. She works well both independently and in teams, which is leveraged by coding in Python and leading field measurements. Currently, Beatriz works as a research associate in the Institute for Modelling Hydraulic and Environmental Systems ([IWS](https://www.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/en/institute/), Universität Stuttgart, Germany), where she also pursues a PhD.
